## Information Collection and Use

You can generally visit our app without having to submit any personally identifiable information about yourself to us. However, to use certain Services and functionality of the app (such as to post a property for rent or request to book a Rental Property), you will be required to register for an account with Foodgiv. When you register for an account, we will collect your name, email address and password. If you are posting a property for rent, we will also collect the address of the rental property and we may request your photo, identification or passport copy and/or copies of your utility bills. If you choose to verify your photo ID, we will collect your government document or passport copy, which will be immediately deleted upon verification.

If you contact us with questions or to request information, we will collect the personally identifiable information that you voluntarily transmit with your communications to us. We also may collect personally identifiable information about you that you elect to upload to the app (such as in rental property descriptions or ratings for properties).

We may use your personally identifiable information to register you to use our app and to provide our rental platform services to you, contact you to deliver certain services or information you have requested, verify your authority to use the app, to detect fraud, improve the content and general administration of the app. We may use your photo, identification or passport copy and/or copies of your utility bills to verify your identity. We may also send you targeted marketing and promotions regarding the app. If you do not wish to receive these marketing or promotions from us, you may opt-out as set forth in the message.

If you register to use our app, you may engage in direct messages with another user through the app. Foodgiv may collect personally identifiable information that you include in such messages and may review such messages from time-to-time for purposes of confirming compliance with Foodgiv’s Terms of Use or to detect and/or investigate email scams or similar fraudulent activities.
